# Japanese Quiz

### About

I've been taking a Japanese class for 1.5 hours a week for two years and I've been trying to learn Kanji.
I thought a little quiz might help my memory.

### How to run

Open up a command prompt and navigate to the directory you downloaded the files to and type:

```python
python KanjiQuiz.py
```

### Things to change

Refactor KanjiData to use Tuples/Named Tuples, use python enumerate()
